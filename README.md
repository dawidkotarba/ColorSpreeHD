Connect as many gems of the same color as possible! The more tiles you connect, the better score you get. Sounds easy?:) You have only 2 minutes! But do not worry - you can get an extra time easily by linking multiple gems together.
Take advantage of Dynamite Tile or Bomb Tile - they activate gems around.
Use extra gems to multiply points by 2. Not enough? Star Tile can make it 3!
You can get them as a reward for selecting multiple blocks. The more you select, the better reward you get :)

Something went wrong? Use second finger to cancel the selection or just swipe to last selected gem.

Good luck, have fun:)
